# logger util
Util for logger.

 * Isomorphic logger.
 *
 * At the server-side it outputs log messages to the console, and also sends
 * them to the https://logentries.com service (only if LOG_ENTRIES_TOKEN is
 * set).
 *
 * At the front-end side it outputs log messages to the console (only when
 * development build of the frontend is used), and sends them to the
 * https://logentries.com service (both dev and prod build of the frontend
 * send messages to the service, proxying them through the App's server;
 * the proxy will forward them to the service only if LOG_ENTRIES_TOKEN is set).
 *
 * In all case, interface of the logger matches that of the standard JS console.
